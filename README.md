# 📊 OFAC SDN Global Risk Monitor: Compliance Analytics Dashboard

The **OFAC SDN Global Risk Monitor** is an interactive data visualization project designed to empower compliance and financial risk teams with rapid, quantifiable assessment of sanctions exposure.  
This solution analyzes *Specially Designated Nationals (SDNs)* data to highlight geographic concentration and entity type exposure across key jurisdictions.  
It leverages Python’s data stack and Streamlit’s interactive capabilities for efficient reporting and compliance monitoring.

### 🔬 Analytical Core: Risk Calculation & Logic

A tiered methodology assigns **Risk Ratings** based on total distinct entities per country.

| Total Distinct Entities (SDNs) | Risk Rating | Color Logic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **> 1000** | **Critical** | 🔴 Red |
| **> 800 to ≤ 1000** | **High** | 🔴 Red |
| **> 600 to ≤ 800** | **Medium High** | 🟠 Orange |
| **> 400 to ≤ 600** | **Medium** | 🟡 Yellow |
| **> 200 to ≤ 400** | **Medium Low** | 🟤 Light Yellow |
| **≤ 200** | **Low** | 🟢 Green |

### 🔝 Key Performance & Risk Indicators (KPI/KRI)

| Indicator | Type | Definition and Business Insight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Distinct Entities** | **KPI** | Count of unique sanctioned entities across jurisdictions — measures total sanctions volume. |
| **Critical Risk Jurisdictions** | **KRI** | Number of countries flagged as *Critical* — indicates top compliance priorities. |
| **Non-Individual Entity Ratio** | **KRI** | Percentage of organizations or vessels (non-individuals) among SDNs — highlights systemic exposure. |
| **Top SDN Concentration** | **KPI** | The highest total count of entities per country, defining concentration risk ceiling. |

### 📂 Data Sources

| File Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **sdn.csv** | Core SDN entity data including names, SDN Type (Individual/Non-Individual), and sanction program details. |
| **add.csv** | Supplementary address data linked by `ent_num`, providing country-level geographic context. |

### 🛠️ Technology Stack

The **Python + Streamlit** implementation of the OFAC Risk Dashboard modernizes the original Excel-based model into a fully automated, interactive web application.  
It integrates data cleansing, dynamic risk modeling, and executive reporting — providing a scalable and intelligent platform for sanctions risk monitoring and analytics.

| Component                         | Technology Used                                  | Function                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| :-------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Integration & ETL**        | **Pandas**                                       | Reads, cleans, and merges the `sdn.csv`, `add.csv`, and `map.csv` datasets on the common key (`ent_num`). Handles invalid or missing country values, applies normalization, and maintains referential integrity between entity and address records.          |
| **Risk Modeling & Calculation**   | **Custom Python Logic (Risk Scoring Functions)** | Implements rule-based risk scoring through defined thresholds using `apply_risk_rating()`. Generates `Risk_Level` and `Risk_Score` columns based on SDN entity volumes per country and sanction program.                                                     |
| **Visualization & Interactivity** | **Plotly Express + Streamlit UI Components**     | Provides dynamic, interactive charts (heatmaps, bar charts, and distributions) with filters for program and country selection, toggle between aggregation types, and detailed tooltips. Uses Streamlit for responsive layout and real-time user interaction. |
| **Automated Reporting**           | **FPDF + HTML Export**                           | Generates downloadable executive-style reports in both PDF and HTML formats, embedding visualizations, legends, and dynamically generated data stories summarizing key business insights.                                                                    |
| **AI-Driven Insights (Optional)** | **GPT-based Narrative Generator**                | Produces an adaptive “Data Story” section summarizing risk concentration, top jurisdictions, and actionable compliance insights based on filtered data selections.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Diagram

![OFAC SDN Global Risk Monitor Architecture](ofac_sdn_readme_diagram.png)

### Textual Description

1. **GitHub Repository**
   - Stores all project files: `app.py`, `config.py`, `ai_agent/`, `requirements*.txt`, etc.  
   - Serves as the source for both Streamlit Cloud and Docker deployments.

2. **Streamlit Cloud (Lightweight Deployment)**
   - Uses `requirements.txt` for core dependencies only.  
   - Provides a **web-accessible dashboard** for data visualization and executive summaries.  
   - Excludes heavy AI / RAG libraries to ensure smooth cloud deployment.

3. **Docker Cloud / Local Docker (Full AI Deployment)**
   - Uses `requirements-docker.txt` for full AI stack including **ValidatorAgent**, **ExecutiveAgent**, **RAG**, and LLM support.  
   - Allows **persistent volumes** for:
     - `/app/data` → CSVs and OFAC datasets  
     - `/app/reports` → PDFs and executive summaries  
     - `/app/models` → LLMs and FAISS embeddings  
   - Enables scalable AI-driven insight generation, data validation, and RAG-powered reporting.

4. **AI Workflow Inside Docker**
   - **ValidatorAgent** validates CSV structure and checks data quality.  
   - **ExecutiveAgent** generates **dashboard insights and executive reports**, leveraging **RAG retrieval** from FAISS vector stores and LLM embeddings.  
   - Streamlit dashboards are updated dynamically with validated data and AI-generated insights.
